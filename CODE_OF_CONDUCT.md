## Code of Conduct

### Introduction

The creators of this repository strive for a comfortable environment that facilitates collaboration and teamwork. We believe that a respectful and welcoming atmosphere allows collaborators to fully utilize their strengths to further improve the project.

### Standards

As a result, collaborators to this repository agree that any behavior that is not respectful towards others is completely unacceptable. In particular, there is zero-tolerance for any derogatory comments or acts related to race, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, knowledge, appearance, religion, or age. Threatening or aggressive comments, both in private or in public, will be removed and offenders will face a ban from contributing to this repository.

Furthermore, any posts that link to or display NSFW (not safe for work) content is strictly prohibited. Any other behavior that is distasteful or blatant trolling will also not be tolerated.

### Responsibilities of Maintainers

The maintainers of the repository have the right to remove, ignore, reject add, or edit any pull requests made by contributors that violate the Code of Conduct. If disciplinary action is required, the maintainers will strive to be as transparent as possible. 

Those who continually violate the Code of Conduct, including the maintainers themselves, will face permanent bans from contributing to this repository.

### Scope

Those who contribute to this repository agree to abide by the principles outlined in the Code of Conduct in any project or public environment associated with this repository. This includes any online pages or applications related to this project (such as GitHub pull requests or issues), and offline meetings. Those who act as representatives of this project in a public environment are to abide by the Code of Conduct.

### Enforcement

Any instances of behavior that violate the Code of Conduct can be reported to the project maintainers through GitHub. The maintainers will then review all of the relevant complaints and ultimately, take the necessary action against the relevant contributor(s) in question. 

Note that this principle also applies to the project maintainers themselves. Maintainers will be disciplined by other project leaders.
