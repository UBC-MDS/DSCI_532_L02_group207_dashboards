# Reflections on BaRley: Group 207

## Strengths:

- The BaRley dashboard allows any farmer interested in the area to easily determine the relationship between different features of barley, like yield and geographic location, with respect to expected yield for the state of Minnesota.
- The BaRley app contains a wide variety of filters that allows the farmer to analyze particular varieties and/or sites in closer detail if they so choose, giving them the flexibility to view what they would like.
- Finally, if the farmer wishes to gauge how the yield might be expected to vary, the year filter allows them to at least get an estimate of how the yield may change over time. At the very least, it displays the entire data set in its entirety so the user can come to their own conclusions as to whether the yields displayed are trustworthy.

## Weaknesses: 

- The shortcomings of this app are mostly related to the data set and how small and specific it is. We only have two years of measured yield rates for each combination of site and variety. Therefore, there may be a large amount of uncertainty in any of the reported yield rates which would lower the utility of the app for the farmer. 
- In addition, the data set only comes from the state of Minnesota which is located in the American Midwest. Thus, the app is only useful for farmers who wish to own property for this specific area. Finally, the dataset uses observed yield rates from 1931 and 1932 which is quite old. Different technologies and climate change, for example, probably have huge impacts on any of these reported yields making the app not as useful for today.

## Future Improvements:

- An “All” option for site and variety would have been useful since it is a nuisance to select each option one by one. 
- The toolbar eats up a lot of space on the screen, and so if it was collapsable we would be able to make the graphs larger (highlighting the most important feature of our dashboard). 
- Finally, including more text in the app that gives more instruction to the user on how the app works (even if it is quite straightforward) would have been useful, perhaps as a mouse-over popup with a (?) symbol on the corner of the toolbar. 

## TA Comments:

- With respect to the TA comments, we improved our usage of GitHub issues by documenting anything that was perceived to be wrong with the app. Furthermore, we divided our work more evenly amongst ourselves, especially with respect to the coding aspect. Every member contributed at least one graphing function or worked extensively on the skeleton of the app.
- We improved our commit messages to be more specific towards what was actually changed, rather than just mentioning the file that was changed.
- Lastly, specific issues/suggestions opened up by each group member such as the [layout of the app](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_532_L02_group207_dashboards/issues/25) and [various bugs](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_532_L02_group207_dashboards/issues/23) were addressed in subsequent pull requests.
